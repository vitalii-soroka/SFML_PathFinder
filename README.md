# SFML_PathFinder

### Introduction
This GitHub project is a C ++ path finder program that makes use of the SFML library.
Users can evaluate and visualize various pathfinding algorithms on a grid.
The application offers an interactive way to draw obstacles on grid, visualize the pathfinding process, and view statistics.

### Technologies used:
The path finder application is built using the following technologies and tools:
- C++ programming language for the application logic
- SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) for graphics and user interface
  
### Features
1. **Grid System:** Board size and dimension can be controlled with properties.
2. **Obstacle Placement:** Users can draw obstacles on the board.
3. **Algorithms variety:** Four different pathfinding algorithms: Breadth-First Search, Greedy Search, Dijkstra's, A*.
4. **Visualizer:** The application visualizes the pathfinding process step by step, allowing to see how each algorithm explores the grid.
5. **Statistics:** The project provides statistics on the performance of each algorithm, such as time taken and number of cells explored.
    
### Installation:
1. [ ] Clone this project from GitHub
2. [ ] Visit the official [SFML](www.sfml-dev.org) website to obtain version 2.6.0 or higher.
3. [ ] In your preferred C ++ IDE or code editor, open the project folder.
4. [ ] Add SFML to your project.
5. [ ] Build and compile the source code.
6. [ ] Run project.

### Usage
- Select one of four boards, by hovering the mouse over the board.
- Press **'S'** to place start point at pouse position.
- Press **'E'** to place end point at mouse position.
- Press **Left/Right** Mouse to place/clean obstacle at mouse position.
- Hold **Left/Right** Mouse and drag the mouse to draw/clean obstacles.
- Press **'Space'** to clear board.
- Press **'F'** to start the search algorithm.
- Press **'R'** to clear visited and path cells.
- Press **'C'** to copy board cells pattern.
- Press **'V'** to paste copied cells pattern.
